##Changing climate

### Changes in the marine environment

##--> Many organisms must "adapt, move, or die"
--when the environment changes, if they are to persist, organisms must be able to cope with change, change themselves, or move ([@maggini_are_2011])

[@root_fingerprints_2003]

###When species move: shifting distributions
####General patterns 
--many terrestrial species from a range of taxanomic groups have moved to higher latitudes and elevations ([@hickling_distributions_2006])

--despite similar climate velocities, within regions, some species have rapidly extended their geographical distributions, while others have moved less, or have even moved in the opposite direction

- but climate velocity was found to explain shifts better than species traits for a range of marine taxa ([@pinsky2013]); however methods used in this study may not have accounted fully for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort in all cases ([@thorson_model-based_2016])
